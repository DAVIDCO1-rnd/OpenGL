# glTF2-loader

`glTF2-loader` is a C++14 [glTF][gltf] ([2.0 only][gltf-2-spec]) parsing library. 

## Building

Bulding should be as simple as executing the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If you're building for Android, you should use cmake with `-DANDROID=TRUE`

The build process should output a static library, `libgltf2-loader.a`.

## Documentation

Coming soon. For now, the code should be well-enough documented inline, but we should definitely have some Doxygen thing going on in the near future.

## Tests

Tests, using the googletest framework, can be enabled with the `BUILD_TESTS` CMake variable. An executable will be created in the `test/` subdirectory, in your build directory.

CI coming soon.
